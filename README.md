This is a compilation of the activities and projects given to members of the AY 2020-2021 Computer Vision Group under Mr. Arren C. Antioquia of the Department of Software Technology, De La Salle University.

## Task
The focus of the activities is to expose the members of the group to technologies and techniques related to the study of computer vision, a "field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs" (<a href = "https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision">IBM</a>, n.d.). 

The notebooks that I worked on for this project are as follows:
