# Computer Vision Group Notebooks
This is a compilation of the activities and projects given to members of the Computer Vision Group.

## Task
The focus of the activities is to expose the members of the group to technologies and techniques related to the study of computer vision, a "field of artificial intelligence that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs" (<a href = "https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision">IBM</a>, n.d.). 

The notebooks that I worked on for this project are as follows:

Period | Notebook No. | Title | Author of the Activity
--- | --- | --- | ---
Term 2, AY 2020-2021 | 1 | Jupyter Notebook and Python | **Mr. Arren C. Antioquia** <br/> arren.antioquia@dlsu.edu.ph
Term 2, AY 2020-2021 | 2 | Vector and Matrix Operations | **Mr. Arren C. Antioquia** <br/> arren.antioquia@dlsu.edu.ph
